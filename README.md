# Open-Warehouse-Sim
# WMS Manager - Warehouse Simulation

A lightweight (142 kb) logistics management game built with Vanilla JS/HTML5.

##  About this Project
This project is a personal challenge only to satisfy my curiosity in vibe-coding with AI agents. **I am a beginner and I don't know how to code.** The entire game was built through an iterative process using **Claude (Anthropic AI)**. 

I designed the logic, the rules, and the warehouse flow, while the AI helped me translate those ideas into functional code. This is why the project is contained in a single file—to keep it manageable for me as I learn. So, thanks you for being indulgent :-)
There are some bugs i don't know how to fix, Claude made some mistakes.
##  Project Goals
The goal is to provide a deep simulation of warehouse operations (hiring, picking, stock management, and shipping) without the need for heavy engines or installations.

##  Contribution Rules (Read before contributing)
I am looking for benevolent contributors to help refine this prototype! However, please respect these constraints:
1. **Core Structure:** Please keep the **"Single File / Vanilla JS"** architecture. I need to be able to understand and maintain the code with the help of AI. No heavy frameworks (React, Vue, etc.), please.
2. **Performance:** The game's strength is its 130kb size. Let's keep it fast and light.
3. **Guidance:** Since I am learning, clear comments in your Pull Requests explaining *why* a change was made would be incredibly helpful!
4. **gameplay** Please keep the initial global gameplay, but feel free to add improvements, elements to make this more "playable".   
##  How to Play
1. Clone the repo or download the HTML file.
2. Open `warehouse manager 111.html` in any modern web browser.
3. Start managing your logistics empire!
